# Mitarbeit Anleitung

The goal of this project is to write a PHP framework that minimizes the time to create new projects.
The collaboration is open to everyone, but the default is to write clear code, says
Free spaces, cleaner syntax, comments, writing documentation as MD

No one works on the Master Branch, results are only merged in these!

### FEATURE
It works with the ```FEATURE``` system, new sections are developed in features and as
```FEATURE/FeatureName``` created, upon completion, will be a pull request on the ```dev/main/unstable``` branch
created. From this the ```TASKs``` of the ```FEATURE``` are created, in which the tasks are divided and done. Once enough features have been collected and tested in the unstable branch, a pull request will be applied to the
Master Branch created. Every merge in the ```master```, sets the version number high, is differentiated here in ```[major].[minor].[patch]```.
